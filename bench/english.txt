English has ceased to be an "English language" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English.[97][98] Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.[99] Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an "Afro-Saxon" language community that unites Africans from different countries.
As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.[47][48][101] For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.[102] English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.[103] However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.[104][105] David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.
Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,[50][108] is also regarded as the first world language.[109][110] English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.[110] English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages[111] Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring[112] and aviation.[113] English has replaced German as the dominant language of scientific research.[114] It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.[115] By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II, English had become pre-eminent [116] and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.[117] It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.
